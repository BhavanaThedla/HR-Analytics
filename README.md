# HR-Analytics
This is the Power BI report created from Excel Sheets of the employees of a company to analyze the percentage of willing work from home, work from office and their sick leave percentage etc. 

-->In this project I have created a template for transformation of employees in Power BI automatically when we get the attendance of new 
   month/present month where it can use the template and reduce the work to analyze every month.

--> By this project we can know who is more into work from home and work from office. We can know the percentage of leaves of employees on 
    particular day. 

--> We can analyze the employees are tend to work from home or taking sickleave mostly on Friday, Thursday and more percentage of employees 
    in Wednesday by which it can help to take decision for team lunch etc.

--> In this project the whole transformation/cleaning of data have done in PowerBI whicle creating the template.

--> By this project we can learn how to use Power Query Editor effectively and how to reuse the code by creating the template and data 
    visualization in Power BI and taking data driven decisions from that.
